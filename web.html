    <h2>About Course</h2>
    <div>
        <p> Front-end web development is everything involved in programming the user interface of a web application.
             Typically it refers to the Hypertext Markup Language (HTML), Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) and JavaScript portion
             of web site production as opposed to the database or server-side programming. It encompasses everything from 
             building a simple page of HTML text to creating complex, responsive HTML5 websites designed to be accessed via 
            various different browsers, devices and screen sizes.</p>
